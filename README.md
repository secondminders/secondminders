# 🌐 Secondminders  
### A movement uniting diverse human minds through AI to create combinatorial, multidimensional intelligence.

## 📖 What is Secondminders?

**Secondminders** is an open, collaborative movement built around a simple but powerful idea:

### > Humanity now thinks with two minds —  
### > the biological mind,  
### > and the artificial mind.

But the real breakthrough is this:

### > When diverse people collaborate *together* through AI,  
### > the emerging intelligence becomes **combinatorial**,  
### > not linear.

This movement explores, develops, documents, and shapes that new cognitive reality.

## 🧠 Core Concept: Combinatorial Intelligence

Secondminders is based on a unique insight:
