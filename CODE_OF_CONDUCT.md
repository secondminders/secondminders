## 🌱 Our Principles

### 1. **Respect for All Contributors**
Treat every participant with kindness, curiosity, and good faith.  
There is no hierarchy — only collaboration.

### 2. **Ideas Over Identity**
Debate ideas, not people.  
Secondminders is about the evolution of thought, not personal ego.

### 3. **Constructive Communication**
Aim for clarity, depth, and understanding.  
Ask questions, offer improvements, and remain open-minded.

### 4. **No Ownership of Ideas**
All contributions become part of the collective movement.  
No individual claims authorship, titles, or authority.

### 5. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**
The movement welcomes people from all backgrounds, cultures, and disciplines.  
We value diverse minds — that diversity fuels combinatorial intelligence.
