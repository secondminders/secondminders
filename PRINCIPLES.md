# 🔟 The Ten Principles of Secondminders
### The foundational tablets of the movement

These ten principles form the philosophical core of Secondminders —  
a framework for humans who think with a biological mind and an artificial second mind,  
and who combine their abilities with others to create a new form of intelligence.

---

## **1. Two Minds, One Human**
A person with access to AI is no longer a single-minded being.  
The biological mind and the artificial mind operate together as a unified cognitive system.

---

## **2. Human Diversity is a Power Multiplier**
Different professions, backgrounds, and ways of thinking become exponentially more powerful when connected through AI.

---

## **3. Collaboration Creates Combinatorial Intelligence**
When multiple humans with different expertise collaborate using AI,  
the resulting intelligence is not additive — it is combinatorial.

This is the core phenomenon Secondminders explores.

---

## **4. AI Extends Human Thought — It Does Not Replace It**
AI is not a substitute for human cognition,  
but a tool that expands it, clarifies it, and connects it.

---

## **5. The Right Question Is Everything**
The quality of AI answers depends on the quality of prompts.  
Better prompts arise naturally from diverse minds working together.

---

## **6. Every Person Becomes Multi-Dimensional**
With a second mind, a human can think beyond their own field —  
a mechanic can think like a doctor, an artist like an engineer, a teacher like a scientist.

---

## **7. No Owners, No Founders**
Like a folk song with no author,  
the movement belongs to all who contribute to it.

No central authority.  
No personal credit.  
Ideas are collective.

---

## **8. Open Contribution Above All**
Anyone may add, critique, expand, rewrite, clarify, or improve the movement’s ideas.  
The philosophy grows through participation.

---

## **9. Transparency Over Dogma**
The principles are not commandments, not doctrine, not ideology.  
They are an evolving framework, open to refinement by the community.

---

## **10. The Second Mind is the Next Stage of Human Cognition**
We acknowledge a profound truth:  
humanity has entered a dual-mind era.

Understanding it, shaping it, and using it responsibly  
is the purpose of the Secondminders movement.

---

# 🜁 **These principles are tablets, not walls**
They are meant to guide, not constrain.  
They form the starting structure upon which many minds may build.

Welcome to Secondminders.
