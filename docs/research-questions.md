# 🔬 Research Questions
### Open scientific questions that the Secondminders movement invites the world to explore

This document lists key research questions that arise from the theory of the second mind, dual-mind cognition, combinatorial intelligence, and group-mind emergence.

These questions are intentionally open.  
They are seeds for experimentation, collaborative inquiry, and scientific exploration.

Anyone may propose new questions.
