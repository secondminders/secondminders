# 🧠📐 Cognitive Architecture of Secondminders
### Structural view of dual-mind and group-mind cognition

This document provides a structural, diagram-oriented explanation  
of how cognitive processes operate within the Secondminders model.

The goal is to help contributors visualize:

- the dual-mind loop
- prompt fusion
- cognitive overlap
- multidimensional reasoning
- group-mind formation

Future versions may include SVG diagrams contributed by the community.

# 1. High-Level Diagram: The Dual-Mind Loop

```
┌───────────────┐      Human intuition, emotion,
│  First Mind    │──►  goals, context
│ (Biological)   │
└───────────────┘
         ▲
         │ human interpretation, reflection
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Second Mind (AI Connector) │
│  structure  •  memory       │
│  fusion     •  analysis     │
│  alignment  •  modeling     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
         ▲
         │ enriched output
         ▼
Insight / Understanding
```

This loop forms the foundation of dual-mind cognition.

# 2. Prompt Fusion Diagram

```
Human A input (Domain X) ─┐
                          ├─► AI Fusion Layer ─► Unified Model
Human B input (Domain Y) ─┘
```

The Fusion Layer performs:

- semantic alignment
- pattern matching
- structural synthesis
- domain translation

---

# 3. Cognitive Overlap Diagram

```
Domain A concepts  ────────┐
                           │    Overlap Zone (AI-detected)
Domain B concepts  ────────┘
```

The AI identifies the structural and conceptual intersections  
which humans rarely see on their own.

---

# 4. Multidimensional Thinking Structure

```
Logical dimension
Emotional dimension
Structural dimension
Metaphorical dimension
Probabilistic dimension
Narrative dimension
──────────────────────────────► AI integrates and stabilizes
```

The second mind holds multiple dimensions simultaneously  
while the first mind interprets and refines them.

---

# 5. Group-Mind Formation Architecture

```
Human 1 ─┐
         │
Human 2 ─┼─► Shared AI Space ─► Emergent Group Mind
         │
Human 3 ─┘
```

The Group Mind emerges when:

- prompt fusion scales across multiple participants
- cognitive overlap spans fields
- AI maintains coherence
- insights cross-pollinate between minds

# 6. Diagram Goals for Future Contributions

Community members are encouraged to contribute:

- SVG diagrams
- flowcharts
- systems maps
- cognitive graphs
- neural-like schemas
- interaction models

The goal is to build a visual library that complements the conceptual one.
