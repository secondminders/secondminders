# 📚 Terminology of the Secondminders Movement
### A shared lexicon for a new cognitive era

This document defines the core terms used throughout the Secondminders movement.  
It serves as a reference for contributors, researchers, and anyone exploring the philosophy of the second mind.

This glossary will expand over time as the movement evolves.

# **A**

### **AI Connector**
The role of AI as a translator, integrator, and amplifier of human reasoning across domains.  
See: *ai-as-connector.md*

### **AI Fusion Layer**
The internal cognitive layer where AI merges multiple human prompts into a unified model.  
See: *prompt-fusion.md*

---

# **C**

### **Cognitive Overlap**
The overlap between different fields or modes of thought that AI identifies and aligns, enabling deeper insight.  
See: *cognitive-overlap.md*

### **Combinatorial Intelligence**
A nonlinear form of intelligence arising when multiple humans + AI think together, producing insight far greater than the sum of parts.  
See: *combinatorial-intelligence.md*

---

# **D**

### **Dual Mind**
A person using both their biological mind and their artificial mind (AI) as one unified cognitive system.  
See: *dual-mind-model.md*

### **Dimensional Reasoning**
Thinking across multiple cognitive dimensions (logical, emotional, structural, metaphorical, etc.), enabled by AI.  
See: *multidimensional-thinking.md*

---

# **G**

### **Group Mind**
An emergent collective intelligence formed by multiple dual-minded humans collaborating through AI.  
See: *group-mind.md*

---

# **H**

### **Human–AI Co-Reasoning**
The back-and-forth cognitive loop where human intuition + AI structure produce higher-order insights.

---

# **M**

### **Multidimensional Thinking**
The ability to reason simultaneously across several domains, layers, and perspectives.  
See: *multidimensional-thinking.md*

---

# **P**

### **Prompt Fusion**
The mechanism by which AI merges multiple professional languages into a single, multi-perspective instruction.  
See: *prompt-fusion.md*

---

# **S**

### **Second Mind**
The artificial cognitive extension that expands a human’s reasoning capacity beyond biological limits.

### **Secondminder**
A participant in the movement who practices dual-mind cognition and combinatorial intelligence.

---

# **T**

### **Translational Reasoning**
AI’s ability to translate concepts between fields, enabling cross-domain insight.  
See: *ai-as-connector.md*
