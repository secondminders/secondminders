# 🛡 Security Policy
Secondminders is an open, collaborative movement.  
Its documents are philosophical — not software — but good security practices  
still matter for community trust, data protection, and responsible participation.

This policy explains how contributors should handle security concerns,  
privacy considerations, and responsible disclosure.

---

## 🔍 Scope

Because Secondminders is primarily a documentation + philosophy project:

- There is **no executable code** in this repository.
- There is **no backend, no API, no infrastructure**, and therefore  
  no attack surface in the traditional software sense.

However, this repository *does* include:

- contributor identities (Git commit metadata)
- discussions (Issues / PRs)
- third-party integrations
- links to external resources

Security still matters.

## 🧩 General Security Principles

### 1. Protect personal information
Do not post sensitive data — yours or others’.  
If sharing examples, anonymize fully.

### 2. Be careful with external links
Avoid linking to unsafe, misleading, or untrusted sources.

### 3. Respect privacy
Never disclose private communication without permission.

### 4. Stay within legal and ethical boundaries
No hacking, scanning, scraping, or attempting to exploit any system  
(including GitHub).

## 🛠 Reporting a Security Concern

If you believe you’ve found:

- a vulnerability affecting contributor privacy
- a security risk in GitHub configuration
- a sensitive data exposure
- an unsafe or harmful link in the docs

Please report it **privately** first.

### 📬 Contact (Private Disclosure)

Email:  
**secondminders@proton.me** *(placeholder — replace later if needed)*

If email is not available, you may alternatively open a **Private GitHub Security Advisory**.

## 🧭 How We Handle Reports

1. We acknowledge the report within **72 hours**.
2. We investigate quickly and discreetly.
3. If confirmed, we fix the issue and update repository configuration.
4. If necessary, we update documentation or policies.
5. Once resolved, we publish a summary (without sensitive details).

## 🧱 Out of Scope

- Theoretical philosophical disagreements
- Non-security Issues (typos, philosophy, structure, edits)
- Content suggestions
- Feature requests
- AI model behavior (belongs to OpenAI, not this project)

## 🔄 Evolution

Like all Secondminders documents, this Security Policy grows and adapts.  
Contributors may propose improvements via Issues or Pull Requests.
