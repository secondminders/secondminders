# 🤝 Contributing to Secondminders
### An open guide for participating in the movement

Secondminders is a collective, open, ownerless movement.  
There are no founders, no hierarchy, no gatekeepers.  
Everyone is invited to contribute, improve, expand, clarify, and co-create.

This document explains how.

# 🌱 Principles of Contribution

## **1. The movement is open-source by nature**
All ideas, improvements, expansions, and discussions are welcome.

## **2. Contributions do not require permission**
You don’t need to ask before suggesting improvements.  
Begin where you feel inspired.

## **3. No personal ownership**
Ideas belong to the collective.  
Contributions are anonymous in spirit, even if GitHub shows your username.

## **4. Respect the purpose**
The goal of Secondminders is clarity, depth, and collaboration — not ideology, not self-promotion.

## **5. Everything can evolve**
Nothing is final.  
All documents — including the principles and manifesto — may be refined by the community.
